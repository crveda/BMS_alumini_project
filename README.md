### BMS Alumni Network
BMS ALumni system is for students/faculties of BMS College of Engineering.
The Alumni website is the portal where you can showcase important institutional announcements, various activities planned, reunions planned, etc.
This is a website where students and teachers of BMS College of Engineering can identify their former graduates who will, in turn, help to raise the profile of the university. Many alumni associations aim to bring together like-minded individuals.

This project was made to bring knowledge to students about various graduates who belong in the Alumni. Alumni can play an active role in voluntary programs like mentoring students in their areas of expertise. They could also play a significant role in contributing scholarships to deserving students.
